# Agent Markdown Parser

This is a quick example of how you could define all of your agents and prompts in a markdown file. The `##` level markdown statements are used to define an agent, and the `###` markdown statements are used to define prompts for that agent. Once the file is parsed, you can use several different functions to get agent and prompt information.

Check out [Agents.md](./src/Resources/Agents.md) for an example of what the markdown file might look like.
